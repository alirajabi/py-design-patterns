implement invariant steps once
localize common behavior for code reusability
easily extend the behavior by subclassing (customisable hook methods
inversion of control(hollywood principle: don't call us, we'll call you) call backs, etc.

strategy vs template
blackbox vs whitebox
runtime vs compile time
less performance vs higher performance
supports more complex varitions vs doesn't
